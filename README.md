# Java Projects (Second Year) ðŸ’»

This repository contains a collection of Java assignments and personal projects developed during the second year of engineering. Each project targets a specific domain, such as management systems, object-oriented design, or interface implementation, showcasing core concepts in Java and software engineering.

## Projects Overview

| Project Name              | Description                                                                                       | Key Features                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Student Management       | Manages student records, departments, marks, GPA/CGPA, and login for students/admin.              | Multi-department support, SGPA/CGPA calculation, record display, admin/student login |
| Employee Management      | Tracks employee data, roles, salaries, and performance across different departments.               | Hierarchical roles (Manager, Developer, Admin), salary components, performance awards |
| Inventory Management     | Inventory and product catalog for warehouse-style businesses, similar to Amazon India.             | Add/remove/search/list products, category management, product activity log |
| Library Management       | Library system for handling books: add, search, delete, update, borrow, and return.                | Book CRUD operations, availability management, interactive menu |
| Interfaces Example       | Demonstrates Java interfaces and implementation with vehicles and maintenance routines.            | Vehicle and Maintenance interfaces, class implementations for Car, Bus, Motorcycle |
| Movie Booking System     | Console-based movie ticket booking simulator with movies, theaters, showtimes, and payment threads.| User login, select movie/theatre/showtime, seat and payment simulation, multi-threaded booking |
| Railway Reservation      | Abstracted booking and ticketing workflow for train ticket system (with user login module).        | Abstract base class for booking, reservation logic, quota, multi-step ticket booking |
| File I/O Utility         | Utilities for working with file operations using Java streams.                                     | Reading/Writing files, demonstration of file handling concepts |

## Progress

- Management Systems: Implemented student, employee, inventory, and library management platforms with command-line interfaces and data handling features.
- OOP and Interfaces: Demonstrated abstraction, inheritance, and interfaces using real-world entities (vehicles, bookings).
- Booking Systems: Developed two booking systems (cinema tickets & railway reservation) using multi-threading and modular design.
- File Operations: Created supplemental utilities for file input/output, enhancing understanding of Java streams.

## Roadmap

- Expand existing systems with more robust features (database integration, GUI).
- Add new domains (e.g., hotel booking, medical record management).
- Refactor using Java collections, generics, and advanced design patterns.

## Repository Structure

- Each project is organized by assignment. For example:
  - StudentManagement.java
  - EmployeeManagement.java
  - MovieBookingSystem.java
  - LibraryManagement.java
- Shared interfaces and utilities are kept in dedicated files such as Interfaces.java and FileIO.java.

## How to Run

- Each `.java` file contains a `main` method for standalone execution.
- Compile using: `javac FileName.java`
- Run using: `java FileName`
